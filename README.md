Comprehensive Tail Worker and Logging Service Proposal

This document describes a complete logging service that supports both Cloudflare Workers and external applications. It includes ingestion handlers, WebSocket streaming, database schema, cron jobs, AI based analysis, and integration examples for Python and Workers.

The service uses D1 for metadata, R2 for long term storage, and supports HTTP API ingestion as well as Tail Workers. It provides cleanup and analysis crons, supports AI agents for summarization and anomaly detection, and includes a query API for logs.

Key Features:
- Dual ingestion from Workers and external services
- D1 and R2 hybrid storage
- Configurable TTL and retention
- Cron cleanup and analysis
- Real time streaming through WebSockets
- AI summarization and anomaly detection
- Batch ingestion and flexible configuration

This architecture provides a production ready, scalable, and intelligent logging service.
